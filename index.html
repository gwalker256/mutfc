        <div><h4>MUTFC RECIEVE UPDATE ON TENDNAME INJURY</h4></div>

        <div><p>Made Up Town have received positive news concerning the hamstring injury sustained by right back Pree Tendname in the match against Stopton FC.</p>
            <p>Tendname, who had been a threat down the right in the early stages of the match, was forced off after half an hour having picked up the injury.</p>
            <p>Following scans undergone with the club’s medical team on Tuesday, we are pleased to confirm that the 26 year old’s injury is not as bad as first feared and should not rule him out for the foreseeable future.</p>
            <p>MUTFC staff are continuing to monitor the injury and the rehab that will follow.</p>
            <p>“He is obviously going to have a bit of work to do to rehabilitate the muscle, but we see it as being very manageable and we have fed back to the Gaffer that he shouldn’t be unavailable for any considerable period of time.” said head of medical Faye Kayless.
